# machinr-learning-classification-of-Iris-data
I have classified an Iris dataset by using machine learning algorithms. Iris data is imported from scikit-learn module in python. data set visualized by using matplotlib library in python. k-nearest-neighbor algorithm is used in machine learning classification. finally, this model is good fit for my data and gives accuracy 97.50% .
